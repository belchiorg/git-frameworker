# Git Frameworker

Git Frameworker is a tool that allows you to quickly bootstrap a project using a framework from GitHub. If the repository you clone contains a `framework.json` file, Git Frameworker will automatically create a CLI to configure and bootstrap the project.

## Installation

To install Git Frameworker, run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g git-frameworker
```

## Using Git Frameworker

To use Git Frameworker, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git-frameworker
```

The cli will guide you through the process of configuring and bootstrapping your project.

## Configuring `framework.json`

The `framework.json` file allows you to configure your project based on your specific needs. Here's an example of what a `framework.json` file might look like:

```json
{
  "projectName": "My Awesome Project",
  "projectDescription": "A brief description of your project",
  "questions": [
    {
      "name": "databaseType",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "options": ["MySQL", "PostgreSQL", "MongoDB"]
    },
    {
      "name": "useAuthentication",
      "type": "confirm",
      "message": "Do you want to use authentication?"
    },
    {
      "name": "eslint",
      "type": "confirm",
      "message": "Do you want to use ESLint?",
      "isPartial": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### `projectName` and `projectDescription`

These two options allow you to specify the name and description of your project. They will be used in the `README.md` file and other documentation generated by the CLI.

### `questions`

The `questions` array allows you to define custom questions that will be asked when the CLI is run. Each question object should have the following properties:

- `name`: A unique name for the question.
- `type`: The type of question (e.g. `input`, `confirm`, `multiple-choice`).
- `message`: The message to display when the question is asked.
- `default` (optional): The default value to use if the user does not provide an answer.
- `options` (required for `multiple-choice`): An array of options for `multiple-choice` questions.

### Supported Question Types

Currently, Git Frameworker supports the following question types:

- `input`: A basic text input.
- `confirm`: A yes/no confirmation question.
- `multiple-choice`: A question with a list of options to choose from.

### Creating the templates

The options passed will only work if you set the templates in the `templates` folder. The templates folder should have the following structure:

```
templates
  ├─── <multiple>:<option>_<confirm>:<true or false>_...
```

### Partial Questions

If the `isPartial` property is set to `true` then this question shoudn't be added in the templates folder. You must create a `partials` folder and create a folder with the name of the question. Inside this folder you must create the templates for the options of the question. The partials folder should have the following structure:

```
partials
  ├─── <question_name>:<option>
       ...
```

The folder should only contain the files that will be changed if the option is selected.

### Example

This is an example of a framework for `backend`

```json
{
  "projectName": "My Awesome Project",
  "projectDescription": "A brief description of your project",
  "questions": [
    {
      "name": "database",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "options": ["MySQL", "PostgreSQL", "MongoDB"]
    },
    {
      "name": "auth",
      "type": "confirm",
      "message": "Do you want to use authentication?"
    },
    {
      "name": "format",
      "type": "confirm",
      "message": "Do you want to have auto formatting?",
      "isPartial": true
    }
  ]
}
```

This would be the right structure for the repository:

```
partials
    └─── format
       └─── <some file for the formatting config>

templates
    ├─── database:MySQL_auth:true
    ├─── database:MySQL_auth:false
    ├─── database:PostgreSQL_auth:true
    ├─── database:PostgreSQL_auth:false
    ├─── database:MongoDB_auth:true
    └─── database:MongoDB_auth:false

framework.json
```
